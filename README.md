[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ulfurinn/cli.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ulfurinn/cli)

This package is a fork/rewrite of `github.com/codegangsta/cli` with the purpose of providing smarter shell completion.

If you want to migrate from `github.com/codegangsta/cli`, you'll need to make minor changes in your command setup as there are differences in exposed types.
